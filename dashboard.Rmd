=====================================

Keras is a user-friendly neural networks API. This application uses the **ResNet50 model**, with weights pre-trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) to enable fast experimentation for prediction of images classes including:

- Animals ü¶ã
- Plants üå≥
- Activities ‚öΩ
- Food üçπ

**What the heck is a Deep Learning model?**

A Deep Learning model (neural net/work) is essentially a bunch of linear models stitched together, capable of abstracting complex non-linear relationships from the training data. These models allow for the modeler to focus on hyper parameter tuning instead of feature engineering.

**What is a pre-trained model?**

A pre-trained model is one which has been previously trained on a similar task other than the current one. It has two parts ‚Äì model architecture and model weights. 

**What are the benefits and tradeoffs?**

A pre-trained model, while not 100% accurate still provides a very useful starting point because the features learned while training on the former task are useful for the new task. [4]  
Tranfering the learnings from the pre-trained model reduces the computational cost from developing a neural net from scratch.
